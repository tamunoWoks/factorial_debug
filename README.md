# Factorial Logging Debug
This Python script demonstrates the use of the logging module to debug and trace program execution. It calculates the factorial of a given number, logging each step of the computation including the current loop variable and the running total. The logging output shows detailed execution flow, making it easier to diagnose issues or understand how the algorithm works.
