# Factorial Debug Logger
###  Description
This script calculates the **factorial** of a given number while using Pythonâ€™s built-in `logging` module to track program execution. It logs every step in the calculation, making it a helpful demonstration of how to integrate debugging and monitoring into your programs.

### Features
- Uses the **logging module** instead of print statements for debugging.
- Logs important events such as:
  - Start and end of the program.
  - Start and end of the factorial function.
  - Each loop iteration, including the current multiplier (`i`) and running total.
- Demonstrates configurable logging output with timestamps and log levels.
